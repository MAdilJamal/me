            <h1>Artificial Intelligence And The Future Around It</h1>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence is by far one of the most fascinating and astounding creations ever made in the history of mankind</p>
            <img src="AI.jfif" alt="">
            <h1>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
            <p>A method for educating a computer, a robot controlled by a computer, or software to think critically and
                creatively like a human mind is known as Artificial Intelligence. <br>
                AI can be developed by studying cognitive function. Intelligent systems and software are made available
                through these research initiatives. </p>
            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence has gone from science fiction to reality in just a few years. Intelligent
                machines that assist humans exist in real life as well as in science fiction films. We now inhabit a
                universe of a.i., which was only a tale a few years ago.</p>
            <p>
                Whether we are conscious of it or not, artificial intelligence technology is now engrained in our
                society and is employed in our daily activities. Nowadays, everyone makes use of AI in their daily
                lives, from chatbots to Google, Alexa and Siri.</p>
            <h1>How AI is Changing the World Around Us</h1>
            <p>
                Artificial intelligence(A.I) is transforming the world around us. It has already made an impact on
                multiple fronts. Not only that, it will change how we work and enjoy our daily life. <br><br>
                <img src="Artificial-Intelligence.jpg" alt="">
                <br>
                Just like you, we are also following the impact of AI. By no means, it will go away. From here on, AI
                will only improve, and we need to adapt to the changes or perish..
            </p>
            <h1>Self driving cars</h1>
            <p>
                Artificial intelligence is changing how we drive cars around us. Road accidents have always been a major
                concern for governments. Self-driving cars can truly change how we drive cars or let machine drive cars
                on the road. With a lot of trials for self-driving cars successful, self-driving cars are on roads in
                many countries including the USA. With time, they will become more ubiquitous and improve the road
                conditions and decrease road accidents considerably.</p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, AI is now part of our daily lives and will continue to be for many years to come. For
                those in the business space, you should align your business process with emerging technologies based on
                AI to remain competitive. Otherwise, you might not be able to play at the same level as companies that
                have embraced AI.</p>
