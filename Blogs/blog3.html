            <h1>5G Network Technology</h1>
            <p>The 5th generation of mobile network or more commonly known as 5G is the new global standard. Just like
                its predecessors 1G, 2G, 3G, and 4G; 5G offers a completely different spectrum.</p>
            <p>
                One of the key features of ChatGPT is its ability to generate human-like text, including the use of
                appropriate grammar, punctuation, and even style. This makes it particularly useful for a wide range
                of
                applications, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and automated writing.</p>
            <p>
                In order to use ChatGPT, you first need to fine-tune the model on a specific task or dataset. This
                can
                be done using the Hugging Face's transformers library, which allows you to easily load the
                pre-trained
                ChatGPT model and fine-tune it on your own data.</p>
            <h1>Speed of 5G</h1>
            <img src="5gspeed.jfif" alt="">
            <p>
                According to a report by GSMA, the worldwide median download speed over 5G was 954% faster than that
                over 4G during Q3 2020. For better understanding, with a 5G network, you would be able to download a 2
                hours movie within 10 seconds as compared to 7 minutes for 4G. That being said, there are several
                determining factors such as location and network traffic that can determine the download speed. </p>
                <p>Here’s what the previous generations of the mobile network were like.
                <br><br>
                First Generation (1G): The first-ever implementation of the mobile network with the delivery of analog
                voice.
                <br><br>
                Second Generation (2G): The introduction of digital voice. One of the most common examples being CDMA
                (Code
                Division Multiple Access.)
                <br><br>
                Third Generation (3G): The implementation and mass usage of mobile data. CDMA 2000 was one of them.
                <br><br>
                Fourth Generation (4G): An enhancement to the era of mobile broadbands.
                <br><br>
                <img src="5gnetwork.jpg" alt="">
                Basically, every new iteration was designed to provide users with more connectivity, while improving the
                speed and reliability all together. 5G is next on the line with a much better experience than ever
                before.
            </p>
            <h1>5G Usage</h1>
            <p>5G is used across three main types of connected services, including enhanced mobile
                broadband, mission-critical communications, and the massive IoT. A defining capability of 5G is that it
                is designed for forward compatibility—the ability to flexibly support future services that are unknown
                today. <br><br>

                <br>
                Enhanced mobile broadband <br>
                In addition to making our smartphones better, 5G mobile technology can usher in new immersive
                experiences such as VR and AR with faster, more uniform data rates, lower latency, and lower
                cost-per-bit.<br><br>
                Mission-critical communications <br>
                5G can enable new services that can transform industries with ultra-reliable, available, low-latency
                links like remote control of critical infrastructure, vehicles, and medical procedures.<br><br>
                Massive IoT <br>
                5G is meant to seamlessly connect a massive number of embedded sensors in virtually everything through
                the ability to scale down in data rates, power, and mobility—providing extremely lean and low-cost
                connectivity solutions.</p>
